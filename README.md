# Rust DNS Resolver
A toy DNS resolver built while following the instruction of [this guide](https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/).
> [!WARNING]
> This is a toy resolver and should not be used as a real one or used as an example for your implementation

```
Usage:
dns-resolver <url>
```
## Output Example
This is an example of a query for twitter.com's A records. The program requests information from one of the root nameservers and receives a response detailing authorities that possess the information we need. The program then makes requests to those authorities to get the necessary A records.
